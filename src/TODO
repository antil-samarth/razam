1. More Robust Configuration Selection: The current configuration selection logic just picks the first matching configuration. You could improve this by:
   - [ ] Presenting a list of all matching configurations to the user and letting them choose.
   - [ ] Prioritizing configurations with a specific sample rate (e.g., 44100 Hz or 48000 Hz) if multiple configurations match.

2. Dynamic Capture Duration: Instead of a fixed 5-second capture, you could:
   - [ ] Let the user specify the capture duration as a command-line argument.

3. Error Handling During Capture: The current error handling in the audio callback closure just prints an error message. You could add more sophisticated error handling, such as:
   - [ ] Stopping the stream gracefully.
   - [ ] Setting a flag to indicate that an error occurred.
   - [ ] Displaying a user-friendly error message.

4. Volume Level Indicator (Difficult): 
   - [ ] This is a more advanced feature, but you could try to display a simple volume level indicator (e.g., a text-based bar graph) while capturing audio. This would involve calculating the amplitude of the audio data in the callback closure.

5. WAV File Naming: 
   - [ ] Let the user provide a filename for recording.
